## Overview
The Wherehouse.io Internship Assignment required completion by developing a React application to visualize data from a Google Sheet in tabular format, along with a sync button to retrieve data from the same sheet.

## Instructions
The assignment entailed cloning the provided Google Sheet into a Google account and then creating a React application to fulfill the specified requirements. The key tasks included:
- Visualizing data from the Google Sheet in tabular format.
- Implementing a sync button to fetch data from the Google Sheet.

## Solution Structure
The solution was organized into two main folders:
- **frontend:** This directory contained all the frontend code for the React application, including the user interface and functionalities for displaying data and syncing with the Google Sheet.
- **backend:** Here, the backend code was developed using Express.js to handle requests from the frontend, fetching data from the Google Sheet API and serving it to the frontend.

## How the Problem Was Solved
1. **Cloning the Repository:** The provided Google Sheet was cloned into a Google account.
2. **Frontend Development:** React components were developed in the `frontend` directory to visualize data from the Google Sheet in tabular format. The sync button functionality was implemented to fetch updated data.
3. **Backend Development:** In the `backend` directory, server-side code using Express.js was written to handle requests from the frontend, fetching data from the Google Sheet API.
4. **Testing and Deployment:** After development, the application was tested locally to ensure proper functionality. Finally, both the frontend and backend code were deployed, making the application accessible online.
